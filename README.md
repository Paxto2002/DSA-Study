# 🚀 My DSA Journey

> Learning Data Structures & Algorithms deeply — not just to memorize, but to **understand**, **implement**, and **internalize**.

## 📚 Learning Resources & Inspiration

- **Complete C++ DSA Course (YouTube – Apna College / Shradha Khapra)**This is the playlist I follow for conceptual + coding practice:[Complete C++ DSA Course Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe137I_EPQd34TsgV6IO55pt) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- **MIT OpenCourseWare – 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms**Deep theoretical backbone, assignments, lecture notes, and videos. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}[MIT 6.006 OCW Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/)
- **Textbook Reference**
  *Introduction to Algorithms* (CLRS) — my go-to for rigorous theory, proofs, and problem sets.

## 🧩 About This Repository

This repo is my **DSA learning scratchpad** — a place where I:

- Write well-commented **C++ implementations**
- Take **notes & summaries** (from lectures, textbook, and OCW)
- Solve practice problems and record observations
- Track progress in mastering each topic

The goal: For anyone who visits, they see my journey in realtime, and for me — I have a clear, organized record.

## 🔍 Topics & Roadmap (Tentative)

Here’s a rough roadmap of the topics I’m (or will be) covering:

- Basics: variables, loops, conditionals
- Time Complexity, Space Complexity
- Arrays & Strings
- Pointers & Memory
- Recursion
- Sorting & Searching
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees (Binary, Balanced, etc.)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, shortest paths)
- Dynamic Programming
- Advanced topics & optimizations

I’ll update this list as I go, marking topics “In Progress”, “Completed”, etc.

## 📫 How to Use / Clone This Repo

1. Clone or fork this repository
2. Navigate into a topic folder
3. Open the `.cpp` files, read the comments and notes
4. Run and tweak the code to fully internalize
5. Try extra / custom problems on each topic

## 🧠 Philosophy & Learning Mindset

> “Don’t just code—*pause, think, and internalize*.”

I believe that:

- Understanding *why* an algorithm works is more important than memorizing it
- After coding, visualize the steps, walk through with examples
- When stuck, revisit theory (CLRS / OCW) rather than guessing
- Consistency > speed — better to master 1 topic a day than half-baked 3
